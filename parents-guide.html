      <h1>Everyday Teaching: A Parent-to-Parent Guide to the Trivium</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! Every day brings moments to teach our kids—even when it’s not planned. 
          Our family journey in classical conversations starts with a simple question: 
          <strong>"What is the purpose of our lives?"</strong> And we believe it’s to 
          <strong>glorify God and enjoy Him forever</strong>. This idea guides everything we do.
        </p>

      <!-- The Trivium Section -->
      <section class="guide-section" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h2>What is the Trivium?</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Trivium—Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric</strong> is a simple way to think about learning together:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> We start by gathering the facts...</li>
          <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Next, we ask “why” and “how”...</li>
          <li><strong>Rhetoric:</strong> Finally, we learn to share what we’ve learned...</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Everyday Moments Section -->
      <section class="guide-section" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h2>Everyday Moments Turned into Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          Let me share a fun example. When we got our Roomba (we call him <strong>Robbie</strong>), 
          we didn’t just watch him clean. We sat down with the kids, looked at his parts—his 
          <em>brain (the control system)</em>, his <em>legs (wheels)</em>, his <em>eyes (sensors)</em>—and talked 
          about his purpose. We compared that to our own lives: just as Robbie is built to sweep and mop, 
          we’re made to <strong>glorify God and enjoy Him</strong>. This simple chat turned an everyday moment 
          into a rich conversation about how God made us with purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll be honest—we’re not perfect at classical conversations. We struggle, get frustrated, and learn along the way. 
          But that’s okay. Every day is a chance to grow, and we do it all by God’s grace.

      <!-- Practical Tips Section -->
      <section class="guide-section" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h2>Practical Tips for Busy Parents</h2>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li>
            <strong>Turn “Car Time” into “Class Time”:</strong> 
            Use a few minutes during your drive to sing memory songs or share a cool fact from the day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Have Mini-Debates at Mealtimes:</strong> 
            Pick a simple topic—maybe how Robbie works or something interesting from your day—and ask everyone what they think.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set Small, Achievable Goals:</strong> 
            Each week, choose one or two small things to focus on, like a Bible verse or a new set of words.
          </li>
        </ul>
